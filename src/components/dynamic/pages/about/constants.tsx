Lazy Cow Bakery is a plant-based bakery located in Seattle's Fremont
            neighborhood. Our mission is to bring joy through our pastries and
            cakes while advocating for a total liberation model. Total, or
            collective liberation is a rounded politic that connects the need
            for liberation from all exploitative models such as imperialism,
            capitalism and colonialism to their intersections with racism,
            sexism, speciesism, transphobia and all other forms of oppression.
            Our members have various intersections in this revolution and we
            hope to create space for radical change. This stance informs our
            veganism and includes members of our community without voices, such
            as non-human persons.
            `;

We care about the fair treatment of all workers and their right to
be treated with dignity and respect. Part of this ethical framework
means that our workers get part ownership of the bakery and to make
decisions about their wages and work hours. If you have the
resources to help us get set up legally as a worker co-op, please
contact us! Lazy Cow Bakery has an associated social justice
organization, La Casa Del Xoloitzcuintle. Casa del Xolo, for short,
is Latinx mutual aid organization that responds to the needs of the
community. Located inside our bakery is our free community fridge &
food pantry. Donations are welcome anytime during normal business
hours.
            `;

We hope to become an essential part of the Fremont neighborhood.
With your help we can build our reputation as a vegan bakery with a
standout business model based on compassion and community.

        In the summer of 2020, Lara de la Rosa (she/her) started Lazy Cow out
        of her basement. Lara has had a love for food and baking since early
        childhood. She moved to Seattle from Tijuana, B.C., Mexico. Lara
        graduated from the University of California in 2018 with a degree in
        Biochemistry. She is now a pastry chef for Lazy Cow and runs the
        social justice organization Casa del Xolo.`,

        Lara loves reading to the sound of swamp noises, saving half the gum
          for later and clawfoot bathtubs.

      Where do I even begin... We have the great privilege of having Katie
      Ferguson (she/her) as our baker. Her cakes are immaculate. She runs on
      cake scraps and Shirley Temples -- I'm pretty sure she will only
      consume something if it's pastel colored. We're trying to incorporate
      more vegetables into her diet.`,

    Don't let the Clairo shirt and demure voice fool you -- this girl is
    savage. Those eyes are like daggers, projecting teenage contempt
    without even saying a thing. And when she does speak, she can take you
    down in max 4 words. Terrifying. She's got strong min pin energy.

      Phoebe Katz (she/her) is one of our bakers. Phoebe effortlessly cranks
          out delectable desserts, she's whip smart and one of the funniest and
          hardest working people I know. She produces a vaguely unhuman laugh
          out of me that no one else does, which is both awesome and scary. She
          has both a coldness and warmth about her that she flips between
          effortlessly, a fact which I find endlessly fascinating. Get you a
          girl who can do both! It's a privilege to know her. A true comrade!`,

     You may have seen Raiza de Vera (she/her) up front working the bar,
     but there's really nothing she can't do. She is not only a barista,
     but a trained cook, yoga instructor and dedicated activist and
     community organizer. Her passion for mutual aid is radiant, she imbues
     intention into all aspects of her life.`,
    text2: `
    Raiza is a wonderfully bubbly, joyful individual. Her joy has this
    oceanic depth to it -- it's the kind of joy that one has to fight for
    every day, and she makes carrying that weight look effortless.

     Milo Citrino (he/him) is one of our bakers. He's from the east coast
          and can do a spot on Queens accent. He is uncharacteristically
          charitable and thoughtful taboot, once he brought me a honeydew mango
          since he knows I forget to eat. How did he know I love honeydew
          mangos? He must've astral projected and saw me in Mexico. I've seen
          firsthand that Milo can put in a 14 hr day and then go out afterwards.
          Enjoy your youth while you can, son! We intend to protect our little
          Icarus at all costs. You've been warned!`,
