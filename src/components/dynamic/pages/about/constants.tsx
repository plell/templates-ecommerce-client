Lazy Cow Bakery is a plant-based bakery located in Seattle's Fremont
            neighborhood. Our mission is to bring joy through our pastries and
            cakes while advocating for a total liberation model. Total, or
            collective liberation is a rounded politic that connects the need
            for liberation from all exploitative models such as imperialism,
            capitalism and colonialism to their intersections with racism,
            sexism, speciesism, transphobia and all other forms of oppression.
            Our members have various intersections in this revolution and we
            hope to create space for radical change. This stance informs our
            veganism and includes members of our community without voices, such
            as non-human persons.
            `;

We care about the fair treatment of all workers and their right to
be treated with dignity and respect. Part of this ethical framework
means that our workers get part ownership of the bakery and to make
decisions about their wages and work hours. If you have the
resources to help us get set up legally as a worker co-op, please
contact us! Lazy Cow Bakery has an associated social justice
organization, La Casa Del Xoloitzcuintle. Casa del Xolo, for short,
is Latinx mutual aid organization that responds to the needs of the
community. Located inside our bakery is our free community fridge &
food pantry. Donations are welcome anytime during normal business
hours.
            `;

We hope to become an essential part of the Fremont neighborhood.
With your help we can build our reputation as a vegan bakery with a
standout business model based on compassion and community.

        In the summer of 2020, Lara de la Rosa (she/her) started Lazy Cow out
        of her basement. Lara has had a love for food and baking since early
        childhood. She moved to Seattle from Tijuana, B.C., Mexico. Lara
        graduated from the University of California in 2018 with a degree in
        Biochemistry. She is now a pastry chef for Lazy Cow and runs the
        social justice organization Casa del Xolo.`,

        Lara loves reading to the sound of swamp noises, saving half the gum

      Where do I even begin... We have the great privilege of having Katie
      Ferguson (she/they) as our baker. Her cakes are immaculate. She runs on
      cake scraps and Shirley Temples -- I'm pretty sure she will only
      consume something if it's pastel colored. We're trying to incorporate
      more vegetables into her diet.`,

    Don't let the Clairo shirt and demure voice fool you -- this girl is
    savage. Those eyes are like daggers, projecting teenage contempt
    without even saying a thing. And when she does speak, she can take you
    down in max 4 words. Terrifying. She's got strong min pin energy.

     Milo Citrino (he/him) is one of our bakers. He's from the east coast
          and can do a spot on Queens accent. He is uncharacteristically
          charitable and thoughtful taboot, once he brought me a honeydew mango
          since he knows I forget to eat. How did he know I love honeydew
          mangos? He must've astral projected and saw me in Mexico. I've seen
          firsthand that Milo can put in a 14 hr day and then go out afterwards.

    Sean Moran (he/him) is equal parts warm and charming. You will probably see him looking comfy and practicing his latte art; or loafing around the piano, as he is a very talented musician. His band, Balcony Bridge, is electric — a rare performance hailed by each of the musicians, which calls out of you the same unselfconscious exuberance they display on stage. Sean is a Renaissance man of feeling, passionate and dedicated.

    There is a calm energy and work ethic Heryk (he/him) brings to the bakery, stemming from a deep self-assurance of his competency and values. His quiet confidence provides a buoyant resilience he displays when things don’t go according to plan. This same resilience propelled him through law school, and now he works freelance. Heryk takes on cases on top of his bakery work to provide deeply needed assistance to undocumented communities, while they attempt to traverse an unnecessarily complicated legal landscape. His fluency in Spanish allows him to help his own Latinx community, as well as talk shit with my mom. He is also genuinely kind, funny and has a true passion for baking.

    Oviya Krishnan (she/her) is now our youngest member, which we love to point out to Katie. She is trailblazing her own major at UW at only 17 and is passionate about everything; she’s bubbly, quick and excited. She’s an exceptional and rounded artist, whether she is dancing on her dance team, doodling on our chalk board, or putting together a sensational outfit. Oviya’s discerning intellect has made her a quick learner, having no barista experience before this job and is now excelling within the first month.

    With the sun rises Susan Huynh (she/her), our opener, and like the sun she is radiant and reliable. When she first started she was quiet, but with trust and time has only blossomed. On the daily Susan flexes her adept creativity in the kitchen, her recipes almost always work the first time, which I can’t say for myself. She has the true instinct of a baker, exceptional style and music taste. She is sweet beyond compare, her energy placates and sets the day off right.
